The Location Tracking for Live Audio project designs and implements a straight forward image processing based tracking system capable of identifying and tracking performers on a stage. The project uses this data to provide a live sound engineer with a location based cueing system which goes beyond basic audio file triggering. The project experiments with a range of audio processes allowing an engineer to design a stage with separate zones in different environments which trigger changes such as reverberation, panning and filtering to a performers microphone depending on where they are stood on the stage. Once setup these zones can automatically apply audio effects making a performer sound as if they are stood in a different environment when the performer enters that environment or zone.
